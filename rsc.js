        <h2>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</h2>
        <p>
            Tom is a young boy. He lives with his Aunt Polly. Tom is very <span class="highlight" data-explanation="smart">clever</span> and likes <span class="highlight" data-explanation="exciting experiences">adventures</span>. One day, Aunt Polly says, "Tom, you must paint the <span class="highlight" data-explanation="a wooden barrier around a yard">fence</span>." The fence is big and white. Tom does not want to paint the fence. He wants to play with his friends. 
            Tom has an idea. He starts painting and <span class="highlight" data-explanation="acts as if">pretends</span> to enjoy it. Soon, his friend Ben comes. Ben says, "Tom, can I paint the fence?" Tom thinks and says, "This is important work. Not everyone can do it." Ben says, "I can do it! Please, let me try." Tom smiles and gives Ben the <span class="highlight" data-explanation="tool for painting">brush</span>.
            Ben paints the fence. Other boys come and also want to paint. They give Tom small <span class="highlight" data-explanation="valuable or special items">treasures</span>: a piece of apple, a blue bottle, a dead rat. Tom becomes rich without working. He sits under a tree, eats an apple, and watches the boys paint the fence.

        <p>
            Hachiko was a real dog who lived in Tokyo in the early 1900s. He was an <span class="highlight" data-explanation="a type of dog">Akita breed</span>, known for loyalty. In 1924, Professor Ueno, who taught at Tokyo University, adopted Hachiko. Every morning, Hachiko walked with the professor to Shibuya Station. The professor took the train to work, and Hachiko went home. In the evening, Hachiko returned to the station to meet his <span class="highlight" data-explanation="owner">master</span>. This became their daily <span class="highlight" data-explanation="regular pattern">routine</span>.
            One day in May 1925, Professor Ueno did not come back. He had died <span class="highlight" data-explanation="quickly and unexpectedly">suddenly</span> at work. Hachiko waited at the station that evening, but the professor did not arrive. Hachiko continued to wait every evening at the same time. People at the station noticed the loyal dog. At first, some were not friendly, but over time, they began to care for him. They brought him food and water. Hachiko's story <span class="highlight" data-explanation="became known">spread</span>, and he became famous in Japan. People admired his loyalty and <span class="highlight" data-explanation="loyalty">faithfulness</span> faithfulness.
            Hachiko waited at the station every day for nearly ten years. He became a <span class="highlight" data-explanation="something that represents an idea">symbol</span> of loyalty and <span class="highlight" data-explanation="strong love or loyalty">devotion</span>. In 1934, a <span class="highlight" data-explanation="a type of metal">bronze</span> statue of Hachiko was placed at Shibuya Station. Hachiko himself was present at the <span class="highlight" data-explanation="a formal event">ceremony</span>. The statue became a popular meeting point and a reminder of Hachiko's <span class="highlight" data-explanation="steady and firm">unwavering</span> loyalty. Hachiko died in March 1935.

        <h2>The Little Prince</h2>
        <p>
            "The Little Prince" is a story by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It tells about a pilot who <span class="highlight" data-explanation="has an accident">crashes</span> his plane in the Sahara Desert. While trying to fix his plane, the pilot meets a small boy, the little prince. The little prince asks the pilot to draw him a sheep. The pilot draws several pictures, but the little prince is not <span class="highlight" data-explanation="happy with the result">satisfied</span> until the pilot draws a simple box, saying the sheep is inside. The little prince is happy with this drawing.
            As they talk, the little prince shares stories of his <span class="highlight" data-explanation="travels">journey</span>. He comes from a <span class="highlight" data-explanation="very small">tiny</span> planet, no bigger than a house. On his planet, he takes care of three <span class="highlight" data-explanation="mountains that can erupt with lava">volcanoes</span> and a beautiful rose. He loves the rose but feels she takes <span class="highlight" data-explanation="benefits unfairly from">advantage</span> of him. To <span class="highlight" data-explanation="travel to learn about">treasures</span> the universe, he decides to leave his planet. He visits several other planets, each <span class="highlight" data-explanation="lived on">inhabited</span> by a single adult. He meets a king who loves to give orders, a <span class="highlight" data-explanation="too proud">vain</span> man who wants <span class="highlight" data-explanation="praise">admiration</span>, a <span class="highlight" data-explanation="a person who drinks too much alcohol">drunkard</span> who drinks to forget, a businessman who counts stars to own them, a lamplighter who lights and <span class="highlight" data-explanation="puts out">extinguishes</span> a lamp every minute, and a<span class="highlight" data-explanation="a person who studies the Earth, maps, and places">geographer</span> who knows nothing of his own world. Each adult shows the little prince how <span class="highlight" data-explanation="unusual or difficult to understand">strange</span> grown-ups can be.
            When the little prince arrives on Earth, he meets a fox. The fox teaches him, "One sees clearly only with the heart. What is <span class="highlight" data-explanation="important">essential</span> is <span class="highlight" data-explanation="cannot be seen">invisible</span> to the eye." The little prince <span class="highlight" data-explanation="understands">realizes</span> he loves his rose because of the time he has spent caring for her. He decides to return home to his planet. The pilot, <span class="highlight" data-explanation="motivated">inspired</span> by the little prince's stories, <span class="highlight" data-explanation="succeeds">manages</span> to fix his plane and leave the desert. He often thinks of the little prince and <span class="highlight" data-explanation="thinks with curiosity">wonders</span> if he also made it home.
